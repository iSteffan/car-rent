# Car rent
Pet project.


Welcome to my car rental services website!

The website consists of three pages:

- Home page with a general description of the services provided by the company.
- A car catalog page with cars of various configurations that users can filter by brand, hourly rental price, and mileage covered by the car during its use.
- A page with advertisements that have been added to favorites by the user.
  
On the first page of the catalog, 8 advertisements are rendered, and the rest can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button.<br/>
Clicking the "heart" button on an advertisement card adds or removes it from the favorites list.<br/>
Clicking the "Learn more" button opens a modal window with detailed information about the car and its rental conditions.<br/>

I use the mockapi service as my database with the following data structure

Due to issue with template this repository was migrated on TypeScript to "car-rent-ts".
